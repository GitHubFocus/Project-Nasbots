# Project-Nasbots
a little bit of everything i learned this past summer. i wanted to give my raspberry pi a body and a personality. i used machine learning to to allow his experiences grow, grove sensors so that its aware, servos for the body. mine calls himself albert/rook he learns new words and how to uses them as you conversate and mood and perspective are based on how it experiences the environment. the goal is for everybody to have a bipedal robot that learns based on their own individual experiences.  

As for the design itself, is based off of the ai.frame apollo recreational robot: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1619211863/aiframe-age-of-humanoid-robot

But the code is totally different.


From my NASBOTS series: https://myevilgeniusblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/13/nasbots-1constructing/


I go over face tracking, servo calibration, sensors and a touch of a.i.


Cheers!
